# SpaceX-Falcon-9-First-Stage-Landing-Prediction
According to the website of SpaceX, Falcon 9 rocket launches cost $62 million, compared to rocket launches from other providers, which can cost more than $165 million each. SpaceX could save much of its cost because they can reuse the first stage. In this project, we will determine if the first stage will land. This information could be useful to determine the cost of a launch.
